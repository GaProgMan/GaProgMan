Jamie "GaProgMan" Taylor is a .NET software craftsman, full stack developer and DevOps engineers, and a podcast creator, producer, editor, and host - i.e. podcasting dogsbody. Since 2016, he has been [writing](https://dotnetcore.gaprogman.com/), speaking and [podcasting](https://dotnetcore.show/) about .NET Core (soon to be renamed .NET 5).

Unlike other content creators, there isn't one single place where you can find all of the things that he creates (but he's working on something, honest). As such, here are a list of places where you can find his content:

- [A Journey in .NET Core](https://dotnetcore.gaprogman.com/)
  - This is a blog which was started back in 2016
  - It chronicles Jamie's journey from .NET Framework into .NET Core
- [The Waffling Taylors](https://wafflingtaylors.rocks/)
  - This started as a video game blog and has evolved into a weekly podcast
  - It is created and hosted with his brother, all about video games
  - It is not very serious at all
- [The .NET Core Show](https://dotnetcore.show/)
  - This is a podcast all about .NET Core and the community around it

## Active Projects

### [The .NET Core Show](https://dotnetcore.show/)

[The .NET Core Show](https://dotnetcore.show/) is a fortnightly podcast about .NET Core and the community around it. 

### [.NET Core Podcast Transcriptions](https://github.com/GaProgMan/NET-Core-Podast-Transcriptions)

[.NET Core Podcast Transcriptions](https://github.com/GaProgMan/NET-Core-Podast-Transcriptions) is a collection of all of the transcriptions for [The .NET Core Show](https://dotnetcore.show/). I am fixing these machine transcriptions in the open, this is partially to show how much effort is required in order to fix machine transcriptions for podcast - showing how much time and effort is required to create an accessibly podcast.

### [OwaspHeaders.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OwaspHeaders.Core/)

[OwaspHeaders.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OwaspHeaders.Core/) is a NuGet package for ASP .NET Core powered websites which aims to simplify the inclusion of [OWASP recommended security headers](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/), which leads to more secure web applications. This open source library is used in a large number of both open source and propriatary applications - I have consulted on several closed source uses of this package.
